# PyJAML 🐪

Python library for working with JAML configuration files

> **JAML** (rhymes with, and also means _"Camel"_) is a flexible and powerful formatting language, designed to be used
> primarily for configuration files.<br><br>
> It supports a variety of data types, and offers a built-in templating engine that is environment and language
> agnostic, which in turn allows for templating and conditionals to be used directly in the configuration file.
